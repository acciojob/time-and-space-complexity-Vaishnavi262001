  <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

  <p>
    Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the size of its input. Writing
    <em>efficient</em> code is important for reducing time complexity and improving overall performance.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Space Complexity</b> is a measure of the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the input size. For example,
    an algorithm that uses linear memory will have a space complexity of O(n).
